    @attr application The application name
    @attr baseurl The base URL of the files to be downloaded. This is the reference "parent" URL, where all remote URL addresses are defined.
    @attr icon The image icon of the application. It should be in a format that the JRE will be able to understand (e.g. PNG).
        For example, if baseurl is http://www.myserver.org/files and icon is icons/mascot.png then the icon URL is http://www.myserver.org/files/icons/mascot.png 
    @attr jupidator The minimum required release of Jupidator. To find the current release number, run Jupidator jar from the command line with no parameters. If no version is provided, no implicit Jupidator library version will be required.

Jupidator can be used in various architectures. With this element we define which architectures we support. Since Jupidator is developed in Java, where multi-platform programming is encouraged, this is reflected here too. Architectures are marked with a "tag" and this "tag" can be used in more than one actual architecture (for example in Mac OS X under PPC and Intel machines at the same time). See also documentation of <a href="#architect_tag">tag attribute</a>
  -->
<!ELEMENT architect (launcher)>
<!--
    @attr tag The tag which marks this architecture. More than one architectures can share the same tag and are used the same by Jupidator. Some special tags exist: "any" and "all". When "any" is used,it matchs all architectures that do <b>not</b> have a specific arch tag defined. Tag "all" matches all targets, and adds it's child elements to the currently most appropriate arch target. So, the final elements are a combination of (a) those either specifically mentioned with "architect" compatible tags <b>or</b> the "any" tag <b>and</b> (b) elements defined by "all" tags.
    @attr os The operating system of this machine. This variable matches current operating system if System property "os.name" starts with this value. This attribute is not case sensitive.
    @attr arch The machine architecture. This variable matches current operating system if System property "os.arch" starts with this value. This attribute is not case sensitive.

    This element is mandatory and defines how the application should be launched after the update procedure. Launching the updater is typically the same across updates, but differs in every platform.
-->
<!ELEMENT launcher (argument*)>
<!--
    @attr exec The executable filename. If arguments are required, these are defined by the nested argument element. Have in mind that variables, like ${JAVABIN}, can be used.

<!ELEMENT version (description, (arch)*)>
<!--
    @attr release <p>The integer value of the current release. This number is checked against the "release" value of the runtime environment.</p>

<!--
    Download a file from the remote location, relative to base URL. The latest file from every version will be taken into account.
-->
<!ELEMENT file (sha1|sha2|md5)*>
<!--
    @attr sourcedir The directory in the source location where this file exists. This is appended to the base URL.
    @attr destdir The destination directory of the file. This directory is <i>not</i> relative to anything. If you want to refer to other locations, like for example the application home, you <i>need</i> to specifically define this location with variables, such as ${APPHOME}.
    @attr name The file name. The name of the file is the same in both the source URL and in the destination directory. If this file is <a href="#file_compress">compressed</a> then the appropriate compression extension is added to the source file name. The compression extension should <i>never</i> be present in this tag (even for package files). If this is a zip or tar file with at least two content files (i.e. is a "package" file), then the value of this attribute is used only to locate the filename on the server and will not be inherited to the destination location. You can use directories inside the zip file to deploy to a deeper level directory.
    @attr size The size of the source file. It will be used to check if the downloaded file has correct size.
    @attr compress <p>The source file is compressed in the server. The following methods can be used: "gzip" "bzip2" "zip" "tar" "tar.gz" "tar.bz2". This extension will be added to the source URL.</p><p>If a file is marked as one of "zip", "tar", "tar.gz" or "tar.bz2", then this is a package file. If only one file is found inside the package file, then this file is treated as a "stream", like the "gzip" and "bzip2" containers, and the filename stored inside the zip file will be ignored. If more than one file is found inside the package file, then all the file contents of this  package file will be unpacked at the <a href="#file_destdir">desired location</a>. This is a convenience method to unpack a bunch of files simultaneously, as a package, without the need to define these files one by one.</p><p>An actual package file which is not marked "compress"-ed with this attribute, is handled like any other regular file, and no decompression is performed.</p>
    @attr ifexists Download and install this file <i>only</i> if this file already exists. If it does not, then this file is ignored.
    @attr forceinstall This attribute is disabled (false) by default. With this default behaviour, if the selected runtime application is under an operating system that takes care of the update process by itself, this file is ignored. If it is enabled, then this file is used no matter what the operating system does. Enable this feature if you want to upgrade parts of the application that are not taken care by the operating system.
